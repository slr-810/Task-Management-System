# Task-Management-System
I built a modern task management web application using a Flask backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend, designed to help users organize tasks with priorities, categories, and due dates. The system supports creating, updating, deleting, and filtering tasksâ€”powered by a clean RESTful API and a fully responsive UI.
On the backend, I used Python 3.8+, Flask, and SQLAlchemy to create scalable API endpoints and manage the database using SQLite (easily swappable with PostgreSQL or MySQL). I implemented CORS handling, proper validation, and modular structure for maintainability.
The frontend was built with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+), using the Fetch API for API interactions. The interface allows users to filter tasks by completion status and priorityâ€”all in real time, without page reloads.
